# URL Encoder Script

This Python script allows users to input a string and receive its URL encoded version. This can be particularly useful in penetration testing, bug bounty programs, and other security research scenarios where URL encoding is needed.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sasquatchchicken/urlEncoder.git
   cd urlEncoder

2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
    python urlEncoder.py


   
    Enter the string to be URL encoded: <your_string_here>


   
    URL encoded string: %3Cyour_encoded_string_here%3E

# Benefits of Using This Script in Pentesting and Bug Bounties
1. Efficient Testing
URL encoding is a common requirement when testing for vulnerabilities such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and SQL Injection. This script simplifies the process by quickly converting payloads into a URL-safe format.

2. Accuracy
Manual URL encoding can lead to errors, which might cause payloads to be ineffective. This script ensures that all characters are correctly encoded, increasing the accuracy of tests.

3. Speed
Automating the URL encoding process saves time, allowing penetration testers and security researchers to focus on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities rather than on manual encoding.

4. Versatility
The script can be used in a variety of scenarios where URL encoding is required, making it a versatile tool in a security researcher's toolkit.

5. Crowdsourced Research
For bug bounty hunters and crowdsourced security researchers, this script provides a reliable and efficient method for encoding payloads, enhancing their workflow and potentially increasing the number of discovered vulnerabilities.
